Write a program for calculating and returning the sums of the absolute differences between adjacent numbers in arrays of positive integers. This must be calculated from the position determined by the current user. In the case of this coding problem, you use three positional arguments and find Total Sum function. The three inputs you would require are the number of elements inside the array, the elements in the array, and the position from which this function will take place. For example, suppose the total number of elements is 5, and these are the elements: 1 2 3 6 4 Then, if we decide to start from the 3rd position or enter 3 as input, the function will occur at ‘3’, the 3rd number in the array. Hence, the sum would be a total of (6-3)+(4-6)= 5\r\n2.	Write a program that will allow you to find out how many clothing pieces in total of a certain length can be extracted from a particular number of cloth pieces. We can estimate the required length for each clothing piece as 10 feet. In this case, we must first decide on the length unit as feet and determine the inputs we need. For this function, we will need two inputs: first the number of pieces (in the array), and the size of each piece in feet inside the array. A cloth merchant has some pieces of cloth of different lengths. He has an order of curtains of length 12 feet. He needs to find out how many curtains can be made from these pieces. The length of pieces of cloth is recorded in feet. For example, suppose the total number of elements is 3,and these are the elements: 0 10 40. Then, the first input is 3 followed by the second input of 0, 10, and 40. Hence, the sum would be a total of 0 + (10/10) + (40/10) = 5th Us, there could be 5 pieces of clothing extracted from these 3 pieces of cloth of variable sizes.', '3', 'Coding Round', '1.
